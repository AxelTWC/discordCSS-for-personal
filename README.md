# discordCSS-for-personal

I edited because I do not like the window border and the title bar. 
It will only be used under my own purposes for my discord customization across my multiple computers

Any Person who would like to find the original theme:
https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Frosted%20Glass

new import:
https://gitcdn.link/cdn/AxelTWC/discordCSS-for-personal/main/editFrostGlass.css

Please notify me if you(developer) wish me to remove this respostiry! I just want to get rid of the window border, I am willing to remove all files if you do not wish me to reuse it for my own purpose
